Advection equations in simulation of oceans, climate and models

Sensitivity of Atmospheric Transport Model Performance to Numerical Advection Schemes and Resolution

- Solid body rotation
	- Undershoot (don't want it, but Smolarki is positive definite, hooray)
 	- Overshoot
	- Unphysical
	- Mass conserving

- Something about advection equations and high resolution

- Advection schemes
	- MOL RG: Method of Lines on Reduced Grid (less dense at north + south poles)
	- 	

- Tests
	- Solid body rotation on sphere/band
	- Exact solution after one full iteration equal to exact solution
- Radon test
	- Chemical transport

- Error measures
	- EMIN
	- EMAX
	- ERR0

- Use images as advection examples (Figure 9)
